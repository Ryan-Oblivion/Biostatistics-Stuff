In the lecture we analysed the warp breaks data for looms
(warpbreaks dataset in R)
It has data on breaks/loom/fixed-yarn-length for different looms,
maybe from a knitting factory. 

We have already analyzed the data using the Poisson as a link function. 

The assignment is to reanalyze the data using the quasipoisson link
function 
How is it different from the results of the Poisson distribution ?
Is it any better ? why ?

If possible, try to  use jtools and plot_summs to plot model variables. 

 

The point of this exercise is to highlight how quasipoisson link function
might be a better alternative to Poisson. Please annotate the logic
of the code in comments (so the code should run by itself and
generate the plots, but also be easy to read and understand the logic).
The goal here is to give you some familiarity with implementing GLM models
for future use in your work. This might be easier to do in a notebook 

 
some code from our lectures are also available here.
