This is an important problem with political implications !
Attached is an op-ed article from the washington post
(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/10/06/zero-correlation-between-state-homicide-rate-and-state-gun-laws/ )
that claimed there was no correlation between gun-control and homicide rates.
But this argument is based on faulty use (abuse) of statistics. You are
going to prove it. 

 
The paper/talk here hints at the problem:
Distance Correlation: A New Tool for Detecting Association
and Measuring Correlation Between Data Sets, Donald St. P. Richards
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06400)
The excel spreadsheet used by the post author is attached (stategundata.xlsx),
the graph from the article is also attached (gun_homicide_graph.jpg) as is
the data extracted from the graph

 
Assignment:

Extract the data from the plot (gun_homicide_graph.jpg ,
using Web Plot Digitizer (https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/ ),
worth learning, as it will be useful in other real-life applications,
(an example output is provided in here data_extracted_from_graph.csv.xlsx)
      
1)  How well does your extracted data files compare with the data in the
excel file of the raw data. What would you use to compare the two sets of data ?
      
      
2) Analyze the data (excel sheet with data is provided) using Pearson's
correlation.
      
      
3) Analyze the data using distance correlation (install the energy package).
      
      
4)  What mistake did the author make?
          

5)  How would you fix the article? (and show there is a correlation between gun laws and homicide rates)

Remember distance correlation is zero if and only if there is no correlation. 
It is always positive, unlike pearson's correlation, which can also take on
negative values (so you cannot see negative correlation easily, better gun laws
lead to lower deaths by gun).
