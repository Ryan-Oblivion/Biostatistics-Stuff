Poisson distribution
=====================
1) The horsekick death data from prussian army (HorseKicks.txt)
is a famous dataset that was first explained by the Poisson distribution
(and led to popular use of the distribution). It is a count of soldiers
in the Prussian cavalry killed by horse kicks, by corp (15 corps) membership
and by year (1875 to 1894).
How would you explain the data using the Poisson distribution ?

Is the data a good fit for the Poisson distribution ? 

Plot the data and show your fit and submit your R code with annotations. 


Use of Boxcox Transformation to make data Gaussian
============================================

2) In the mrnaseq_count_data.xlsx file,
   a) for each column determine the boxcox transform that would make them
      gaussian
   b) is there a universal transform ?
   c) would a log-transform be good enough  ?

The log-transform is often used to transform expression data.
